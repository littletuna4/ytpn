The nature of open source software often prioritizes feature development over security, reliability, and consistency. This can make it challenging to use in environments where safety and stability are paramount. While some open source projects are developed with commercial rigor before being released, this isn't always the case. The varying maturity and adherence to standards in open source projects can also complicate governance and make them less suitable for critical applications."}]
